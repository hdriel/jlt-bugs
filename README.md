Try it out with [Live Demo](https://hdriel.github.io/jlt-bugs/)

This is a project for the course 'Just Like That' in the chapter "Bugs" <br>

And bugs were planted here on purpose! <br>

The partial list of bugs that must be addressed during the lecture are:

 1. UI - Missing all styles 
 2. UI - Font size for 'Question #1/5' should be bigger twice
 3. UI - Incorrect 'cart' icon for submit, instead of 'send'
 4. Logic - Input should accept only numbers
 5. Logic - The Submit button not response
 6. Cyber - The result input is always enable - allow to user to hack the system
 7. Logic - Game over have not showing
 8. UX - Click Enter should fire only if some value inserted to inputs 
 9. UX - Enter press on game over should restart the game 
 10. Feature - The questions came in shuffled order 
 11. Architecture - need to allow another types of questions, like Trivia. 
 
[Afek Sakaju](https://github.com/afekTheMiniLearner) going to solve all these (10) questions in a live lecture about bugs
